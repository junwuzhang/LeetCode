 * Testcase Example:  '"abcabcbb"'
 *
 * Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating
 * characters.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "abcabcbb"
 * Output: 3 
 * Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "bbbbb"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "pwwkew"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
 * ‚Å†            Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a
 * subsequence and not a substring.
